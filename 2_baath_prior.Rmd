# Baath's Prior
Our first analysis will replicate that conducted by Baath, who constructs the prior on $(p,s)$ as follows.

## Defining the Prior

First a prior is placed on $n$, the overall total number of socks that are believed to be in the washing machine. He chooses to use a negative binomial distribution. Baath chooses parameters for this distribution based on prior knowledge that Broman is one in a family of four, and a belief that Broman only runs one wash per week, and as such decided to use a negative binomial distribution with mean $\mu = 30$ (corresponding to 15 pairs of socks), with a standard deviation of $\sigma = 15$; we denote this distribution by $P_{\mu,\sigma}(n)$.

```{r}
prior_n <- function(n, mu = 30, sigma = 15){
  
  size <- -mu^2 / (mu - sigma^2)
  
  prior_prob <- dnbinom(n, mu = mu, size = size)
  
  return(prior_prob)
}
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data_frame(n = 1:100, prior_n = prior_n(n)) %>% ggplot(aes(n, prior_n)) +geom_bar(stat="identity", position= "dodge") +
  ggtitle("Prior distribution for n, the total number of socks.")
```

Having determined the total number of socks that he expects there to be in any given wash, Baath then uses a prior for the proportion of socks that are pairs, as opposed to singletons. Denoting this proportion $\theta = 2p/(2p + s)$, Baath places on this a Beta prior (the natural choice for a proportion measure between 0 and 1). This has prior parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ which are chosen to be $\alpha = 15, \, \beta = 2$, which were chosen to conform with his own laundry habits. We will denote this distribution by $P_{\alpha,\beta}(\theta)$.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data_frame(theta = c(0,1)) %>% ggplot(aes(theta)) + stat_function(fun = function(theta){ dbeta(theta, shape1= 15, shape2 = 2)}) +
  ylab("Probability Density") + ggtitle("Prior distribution for the proportion of socks that are in pairs.")
```

We now have to work out how to turn priors on $n$ and $\theta$ into priors for $p,s$; this is handled fairly easily in Baath's original computation approach through a sampling process:
  
  1. Sample $n$, and $\theta$ from the respective prior distributions defined above.
  2. Let $p =  \left[ \theta \rfloor n/2 \lfloor \right]$, where $\rfloor x \lfloor$ denotes the floor of $x$, and $\left[x\right]$ denotes $x$ rounded to the nearest integer.
  3. Let $s = n - 2p$.
  
Without providing full details, following these steps mathematically leads to the following formula for the prior distribution of $(p,s)$

$$
P(p,s) = P_{\mu,\sigma}(2p+s) \left\{ F_{\alpha,\beta}\left(\frac{2p +1}{2\lfloor p + s/2 \rfloor}\right) - F_{\alpha,\beta}\left(\frac{2p -1}{2\lfloor p + s/2 \rfloor}\right) \right\},
$$
where $F_{\alpha,\beta}(t) = P_{\alpha, \beta}(\theta \leq t)$ is the cummulative density of the Beta distribution; the term in braces corresponds to the probability that $\theta$ lies in the range of values that when multiplied by $2p + s$, and rounded to the nearest integer returns the answer of $p$.

We define the prior below



```{r}
log_prior_baath <- function(p,s, mu = 30, sigma = 15, alpha = 15, beta = 2){
  
  if(min(alpha,beta) == 0 & s > 0){
    return(-Inf)
  }
  
  n <- 2*p + s
  
  prior_n <- prior_n(n, mu, sigma)
  
  theta_hgh <- (2*p + 1)/(2 * floor(n/2) ) 
  theta_low <- (2*p - 1)/(2 * floor(n/2) )
  
  theta_hgh <- (theta_hgh %>% max(.,0)) %>% min(.,1)
  theta_low <- (theta_low %>% max(.,0)) %>% min(.,1)
  
  prior_theta <-pbeta(theta_hgh, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta) - pbeta(theta_low, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta)
  
  return( log(prior_n) + log(prior_theta))
}

log_prior_baath <- Vectorize(log_prior_baath)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- crossing(data_frame(p = 0:50), data_frame(s = 0:50)) %>%
  mutate(n = 2*p + s,
         log_prior = log_prior_baath(p,s, alpha=15,beta=2 ),
         prior = exp(log_prior)
         ) %>%
  filter(is.infinite(log_prior) == FALSE)

prior_mode <- df %>% slice(which.max(log_prior))
```
The 2D density plot below shows how the prior distribution varies over combinations of (2p,s); the highest density goes to the scenario in which there are a total of `r prior_mode[,"n"]` socks, made up of $p = `r prior_mode[,"p"]`$ pairs and $s = `r prior_mode[,"s"]`$ singletons.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(wesanderson)

df %>% filter(p <= 30, s <= 10) %>% ggplot(aes(2*p, s, color = prior)) + geom_point(size = 4) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = wes_palette("Zissou1", 1000, type = "continuous")) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,50,by=4)) +
  xlab("2p - Total socks that are in pairs") + ylab("s - Singleton socks") +
  ggtitle("Baath's Prior distribution over (2p,s).")
```


```{r}
knitr::knit_exit()
```

## Posterior Analysis
Having defined the prior distribution, and already having described the processing steps to derive the posterior, we can now immediately obtain the posterior distribution:

```{r}
socks_baath <- socks_bayes(p_max = 50, s_max = 50, k = 11, log_likelihood = log_likelihood, log_prior = log_prior_baath)
```

```{r}
posterior_mode <- socks_baath %>% slice(which.max(log_posterior))
```
As with the prior, we can now plot the posterior density as a function of $(2p,s)$, and find that the single most likely scenario in the posterior is that there was a total of $n = `r posterior_mode[,"n"]`$ socks, made up of $p = `r posterior_mode[,"p"]`$ pairs and $s = `r posterior_mode[,"s"]`$ singletons.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
socks_baath %>% filter(p <= 30, s <= 10) %>%ggplot(aes(2*p, s, color = posterior)) + geom_point(size = 4) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colours = wes_palette("Zissou1", 1000, type = "continuous")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,50,by=4)) +
  xlab("2p - Total socks that are in pairs") + ylab("s - Singleton socks") +
  ggtitle("Baath's Posterior distribution over (2p,s).")
```

Alternatively we can calculate the density of total socks - disregarding the breakdown into pairs and singletons.

```{r}
total_socks_baath <- socks_baath %>% group_by(n) %>%
  summarise(
    prior = sum(prior),
    posterior = sum(posterior)
  ) %>% ungroup() %>% arrange(n) %>%
  mutate(
    prior_accum = cumsum(prior),
    posterior_accum = cumsum(posterior)
  )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
total_socks_baath %>% filter(prior > 0) %>% ggplot(aes(n, posterior)) + geom_line() + geom_line(aes(n, prior), linetype = "dashed")
```



# A Factored Prior
Baath's prior assumes that singleton socks make up a certain proportion of the total number of socks, and then puts a prior on this proportion, and the total number.

An alternative approach is to assume that the number of pairs of socks, and the number of singleton socks are independently distributed. One advantage of this model is the relative simplicity in defining the prior, which we no longer have to re-parameterise from $(n,\theta)$ to $(p,s)$. Whether or not this independence assumption is more reflective of actual washing practice remains open to debate.

Like Baath, we will use negative binomial distributions to model the number of socks, but now use separate distributions for each of $p$, and $s$. Following Baath (for reasons that will become clear below) we will parameterise the distributions in terms of the mean and standard deviation of the distributions:
  
  $$ p \sim \text{NBin}(\mu_p, \sigma_p), \qquad s \sim \text{NBin}(\mu_s, \sigma_s).$$
  In the natural parameterisation of the negative binomial, this equates to parameters

$$\mu = \frac{qr}{(1-q)}, \qquad \sigma^2 = \frac{\mu}{(1-q)}$$
  Or:
  $$ q = 1 - \mu/\sigma^2, \qquad r = \mu  \frac{\mu/\sigma^2}{1 - \mu/\sigma^2} = \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2/\mu - 1} = \frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2 - \mu}$$
  To closely match the prior that Baath constructed, we want that $\mathbf E[ 2p + s] = 2\mu_p = \mu_s = 30$, and moreover that $\mathbf E[(2p)/(s+2p)] = 15/17$
  
  $$ \text{Var}(2p + s) = 4 \text{Var}(p) + \text{Var}(s) = 15^2$$.

where we choose to parameterise the distributions via their mean and , which is the parameterisation used by Baath. Our intent will be to choose the parameters to closely match those used by Baath for the distribution We will make use of the  particular property of negative binomial distributions


For our purposes we will assume that the number of pairs and singletons is Poisson distributed with respective means $\mu_p = 13.25$ and $\mu_s = 3.5$; note that the parameters have been chosen so that the summary statistics for the prior are close to those of Baath. 
p2 = rnbinom(n = n, mu = 13, size = 5.5),

```{r}
log_prior_factored <- function(p,s, mu_p = 13, mu_s = 4, size_p = 5.5, size_s = 3){
  
  log_prior_p <- dnbinom(p, mu = mu_p, size = size_p, log = TRUE)
  log_prior_s <- dnbinom(s, mu = mu_s, size = size_s, log = TRUE)
  
  return( log_prior_p + log_prior_s)
}


log_prior_factored <- Vectorize(log_prior_factored)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- crossing(data_frame(p = 0:50), data_frame(s = 0:50)) %>%
  mutate(n = 2*p + s,
         log_prior = log_prior_factored(p,s),
         prior = exp(log_prior)
  ) %>%
  filter(is.infinite(log_prior) == FALSE)

prior_mode <- df %>% slice(which.max(log_prior))
```
The 2D density plot below shows how the prior distribution varies over combinations of (2p,s); the highest density goes to the scenario in which there are a total of `r prior_mode[,"n"]` socks, made up of $p = `r prior_mode[,"p"]`$ pairs and $s = `r prior_mode[,"s"]`$ singletons.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(wesanderson)

df %>% filter(p <= 30, s <= 10) %>% ggplot(aes(2*p, s, color = prior)) + geom_point(size = 4) +

  ggtitle("Baath's Prior distribution over (2p,s).")
```

  ggtitle("Baath's Posterior distribution over (2p,s).")
```

```{r}
total_socks_factored <- socks_factored %>% group_by(n) %>%

    posterior = sum(posterior)
  ) %>% ungroup() %>% arrange(n) %>%
  mutate(
    prior_accum = cumsum(prior),
    posterior_accum = cumsum(posterior)
  )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
total_socks_factored %>% filter(prior > 0) %>% ggplot(aes(n, posterior)) + geom_line() + geom_line(aes(n, prior), linetype = "dashed")
```

# Was the 11th Sock a Stopping Time?
The analysis so far, and that of Baath, has supposed that Broman chose to stop at the 11th sock by free will, before continuing to unload his washing. An alternative hypothesis might be that Broman saw that the 12th sock was going to break this streak, and so decided to tweet at this point.

This is not an update to our prior beliefs of the parameters, but rather to the probabilistic model itself, i.e.a change in the likelihood.

The revised likelihood can be expressed as

$$L(p,s|k) = 
  \frac{ \sum_{j=0}^s 2^{k-j} \binom{s}{j} \binom{p}{k-j} }{ \binom{2p + s}{k}}
$$
  
  $$\tilde L(p,s|k) = 
  \frac{ \binom{k}{1} \sum_{j=0}^s 2^{k-j} \binom{s}{j} \binom{p}{k-j} }{ \binom{2p + s}{k + 1}} = k \frac{\binom{2p+s}{k}}{\binom{2p+s}{k+1}}  L(p,s|k) = \frac{ k (k+1) }{2p+s - k} L(p,s|k)
$$
  ```{r}
log_likelihood_stopped <- function(p,s,k){
  
  if(k + 1> 2*p + s){ return(-Inf)}
  
  log(k) + log(k+1) - log(2*p + s -k) + log_likelihood(p,s,k)
  
}

log_likelihood_stopped <- Vectorize(log_likelihood_stopped)
```

```{r}
socks_stopped <- socks_bayes(p_max = 50, s_max = 50, k = 11, log_likelihood = log_likelihood_stopped, log_prior = log_prior_baath)
```

posterior_mode <- socks_stopped %>% slice(which.max(log_posterior))
